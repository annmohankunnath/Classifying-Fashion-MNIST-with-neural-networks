This repository contains the code for Classifying Fashion MNIST with Neural Networks. I did this exercise as a part of Udacity's Computer Vision Nano Degree Program.

The Fashion MNIST dataset is available in the torchvision library. Each image in this dataset is a clothing. Each image is 28 * 28 pixels and can been classfied into 10 classes of clothing namely T-shirt/top,Trouser  ,Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal , Shirt, Sneaker , Bag and Ankle Boot.

A neural network is created and trained to classify these images into the appropritate category and tested. The chosen loss criterion is Cross Entropy Loss and the optimizer is Stochastic Gradient Descent with a learning rate of .01.

FASHION_MNIST Exercise is the main file which is a Jupyter notebook with descriptions, comments and a test case. helper. py is a helper file that contains functions to display and classify the images.
